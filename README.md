# ulauncher-cursor-recent

> ðŸ’» Open recent Cursor folders and files using Ulauncher.

Quickly open recently-opened Cursor project directories and files.

**[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)** is a fork of VS Code enhaced with AI features developed by [Anysphere](https://anysphere.inc/).

This Ulauncher plugin is a fork of [*ulauncher-vscode-recent*](https://github.com/plibither8/ulauncher-vscode-recent) by [**plibither8**](https://github.com/plibither8/ulauncher-vscode-recent) to support Cursor as opposed to vanila VS Code.

## Install

### Requirements

- [Ulauncher 5](https://ulauncher.io/)
- Python >= 3
- `fuzzywuzzy` module.
  Install this using `pip`: `pip install fuzzywuzzy`

### Steps

1. Ulauncher > Preferences > Extensions > Add extension

2. Paste the following URL:

```
https://github.com/gekul/ulauncher-cursor-recent
```
3. Create cursor shortcut to be available from bash.
    <details>
    <summary>Reasoning</summary>
    Cursor is currently distributed as an AppImage binary.

    Which gets updated changing the name and has no terminal command by default, therefore, can't be called by the plugin.

    Thus, let's add shortcut to have your `cursor` available from bash.
    </details>

   
   1. `sudo nano /bin/cursor` and 
   2. paste (*ctrl+shift+v*):
      ```
      #!/bin/bash
      cd /your/path/to/AppImageBinary
      ./cursor-*.AppImage $1 $2
      ```
   3. Save (*ctrl+o*) and Exit (*ctrl+x*)
    <details>
    <summary>Script Explanation</summary>

This extension should now be set up and work.
